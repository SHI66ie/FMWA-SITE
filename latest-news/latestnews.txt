FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WOMEN AFFAIRS INAUGURATES ACTU COMMITTEE TO BOLSTER TRANSPARENCY AND ETHICAL GOVERNANCE

…ICPC Chairman Commends Ministry’s Commitment to Anti-Corruption Agenda

In a landmark move toward institutional integrity and ethical public service delivery, the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs (FMWA) on Wednesday, 30th July 2025, inaugurated its Anti-Corruption and Transparency Unit (ACTU) Committee, under the supervision of the Department of Special Duties. The ceremony, held at the Ministry's headquarters in Abuja, marks a renewed commitment to transparency, accountability, and the Federal Government’s zero-tolerance stance on corruption.

Delivering her opening remarks, the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Maryam Ismaila Keshinro, warmly welcomed dignitaries and expressed appreciation to the Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), Dr. Musa Adamu Aliyu, SAN, for his unwavering support and partnership in the national anti-corruption crusade.

“This inauguration is more than a ceremony—it is a call to action,” she declared. “While ACTU serves as the institutional anchor, the fight against corruption is a shared responsibility that requires vigilance, integrity, and the full engagement of every staff member.”

Dr. Keshinro reaffirmed the Ministry’s zero-tolerance policy for corruption, aligning with the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, which prioritizes good governance, service delivery, and ethical conduct across all sectors.

In his goodwill message, the ICPC Chairman, Dr. Musa Adamu Aliyu, SAN, lauded the Ministry’s initiative and commitment to institutional reform. He emphasized that ACTUs are not competitors of management, but complementary bodies established to identify weaknesses in systems, monitor budget implementation, ensure compliance with ethics, and support overall institutional performance.

“ACTU is now recognized as a formal anti-corruption mechanism within the public service framework,” Dr. Aliyu stated. “With support from management, including adequate funding, office space, and committee representation, ACTU can truly deliver on its mandate.”

Key Responsibilities of the ACTU Committee Include:

1. Conducting staff sensitization and training on anti-corruption and ethical standards.


2. Reviewing organizational procedures to identify corruption-prone areas and recommend solutions.


3. Conducting corruption risk assessments (CRA) to detect vulnerabilities.


4. Developing and monitoring the Ministry’s Code of Ethics.


5. Overseeing budget implementation to ensure transparency.


6. Coordinating the deployment of the Ethics and Integrity Compliance Scorecard.


7. Undertaking preliminary investigations into complaints and reports.

The newly inaugurated members of the FMWA ACTU Committee are:

Mr. Musa Aliyu Musa – Chairman

Mrs. Obiako Kate Ukamaka – Secretary

Mrs. Tubomo Q. Lifu – Member

Mr. Dibor Ogochukwu C.

Mrs. Ebune Miriam Ugbede
